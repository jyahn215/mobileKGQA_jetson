Here are the guidelines for formulating a question based on the given factual triples, object of the question, and the answer:
1. A factual triple consists of a head entity, a tail entity, and their relationship, representing a real-world fact. For example, (Gino Finizio, sex or gender, male) indicates that Gino Finizio is male.
2. Your question should pertain to the provided entity based on the factual background, and the answer provided should align with the provided answer.
3. The question should include all of the given information as constraints, except for the provided answer, to ensure that all provided information is fully considered in deriving the answer.
4. Utilize as many different entities and relations as possible in the question to promote variety.
5. Questions should generally be one to two sentences and require no added content aside from the question itself.
6. Use subordinate clauses to link multiple triples in the question, excluding intervening entities when possible. For example, the knowledge “(Elevator Action, platform, Commodore 64), (Commodore 64, Giphyusername, commodore)” can be conveyed as “What is the Giphy username for the platform of Elevator Action?”

We provide a set of 4 examples that you can reference:
