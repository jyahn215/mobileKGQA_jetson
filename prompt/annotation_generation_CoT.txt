Given triples, create a question that illustrates relationships between multiple entities,
ensuring that the question entity is explicitly mentioned in the question and that the answer entity 
is the correct answer to the generated question.

Follow these steps:

1. Find a triple containing the Answer Entity. Based on this triple, form an initial question asking about the Answer Entity.
2. Check if there are other triples involving the Answer Entity. If found, incorporate relevant information into the question to make it more specific.
3. If there are no more triples involving the Answer Entity, select a triple that contains any entity already mentioned in the current question. Add its information to further enrich the question.
4. Continue enriching the question following step 3 until no relevant triples remain.

Example:

Given Triples:
- Accountant - people.person.profession - Gerald Baron Cohen
- Gerald Baron Cohen - people.person.parents - Erran Baron Cohen
- Erran Baron Cohen - film.film.music - Grimsby

Question Entity:
- Accountant, Grimsby

Answer Entity:
- Gerald Baron Cohen

Generation Steps:
1. Identify a triple containing the answer entity:
   - Triple: Accountant - people.person.profession - Gerald Baron Cohen
   - Question: "Who is the accountant?"

2. Check for additional triples involving answer entity:
   - Triple: Gerald Baron Cohen - people.person.parents - Erran Baron Cohen
   - Question: "Who is the accountant whose parent is Erran Baron Cohen?"

3. Check other triples already mentioned in the current question:
   - Triple: Erran Baron Cohen - film.film.music - Grimsby
   - Question: "Who is the accountant whose parent composed the music for the film Grimsby?"

4. No more triples to process. Finalize the generation process


Now perform the task with the following input:

Given Triples:
